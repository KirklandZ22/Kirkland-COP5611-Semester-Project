This code is for the COP5611 Semester Project. It was an emulator using WASM, v86, and basic website design such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to host different operating systems. <br>

To run this code I used the Node.js tool of http-server to have the emulator run locally while also being able to work around any CORS issues. To be able to get http-server and test the functionality of this project follow the instructions in this github. https://github.com/http-party/http-server#readme<br>

It is also important to know that the only uploaded image is the KolibriOS due to the iso files being too large for GitHub. <br>
